As an AI enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for new AI-powered tools and technologies to make my life easier. Recently, I stumbled upon Chart-GPT, a game-changing tool that transforms text into beautiful charts within seconds with the help of OpenAI's APIs.

The moment I discovered it, I knew I had to try it out and share my experience with you all. So, in this blog post, I'll guide you through the installation process of Chart-GPT so you, too, can start exploring its powerful capabilities.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

To begin our journey, we'll first need to get our hands on the Chart-GPT codebase. Thankfully, this is a breeze with Git. Open up your favorite terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoiskatrin/chart-gpt.git
```

This command will create a new directory called `chart-gpt` on your local machine and download the necessary files into it.

## Step 2: Enter the Chart-GPT Directory

With the repository cloned, it's time to navigate to the new chart-gpt directory. Simply run:

```bash
cd chart-gpt
```

Now we're inside the Chart-GPT directory, where all the magic happens!

## Step 3: Set Up Your Environment Variables

Before diving in, we need to configure a few settings. Chart-GPT uses environment variables to manage your OpenAI API key. First, create a copy of the `.env.example` template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This command duplicates the `.env.example` file, creating a new file called `.env`. Open this file in your preferred text editor and replace `your-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Make sure to save the changes and close the file.

## Step 4: Install Dependencies and Start the Development Server

We're almost there! Now it's time to install the required dependencies for Chart-GPT. If you're using npm, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer yarn, run:

```bash
yarn
```

With the dependencies installed, we can finally start the development server. For npm users, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And voilà! The development server is up and running at http://localhost:3000. Open your favorite web browser, type in the address, and get ready to experience the power of Chart-GPT.
