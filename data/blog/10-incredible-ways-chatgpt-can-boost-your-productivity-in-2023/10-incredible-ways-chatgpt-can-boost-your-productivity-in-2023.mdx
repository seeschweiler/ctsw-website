## 7. Search

ChatGPT is able to be an alternative to classic search engines like Google. ChatGPT is free to use, comes with no ads and provides search results directly. In contrast to search engines you do not need to first click on a link to website and then extract the answer from the content given on site.

However: You need to keep in mind that ChatGPT was trained on information up until 2021. So ChatGPT is not able to provide you with answers to search results for recent topics.

## 8. Code Generation & Code Correction

ChatGPT is great in generating source code for you. You just need to tell ChatGPT which programming language to use and you need to provide a description of the programming problem which should be solved. Take a look at the following simple example:
