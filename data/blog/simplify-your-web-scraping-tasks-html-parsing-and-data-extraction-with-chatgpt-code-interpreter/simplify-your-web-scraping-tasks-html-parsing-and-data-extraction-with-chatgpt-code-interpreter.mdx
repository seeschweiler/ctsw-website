Welcome, dear friends and fellow data enthusiasts! Today, I have some truly exciting news to share with you. If you’re anything like me, you’ve undoubtedly found yourself immersed in the world of web scraping — that incredible, albeit at times a tad daunting, realm where data extraction, HTML parsing, and intricate algorithms collide. Well, let me tell you — today, that world is about to get a whole lot more approachable.

Imagine this - a tool that simplifies your web scraping tasks, making HTML parsing and data extraction not just accessible, but downright easy. No more grappling with complex code, no more untangling intricate strings of HTML. Does that sound too good to be true? It isn't, thanks to OpenAI's latest game-changer, the innovative feature called Code Interpreter in their phenomenal AI model - ChatGPT.

That's right - the already impressive ChatGPT is now boasting a new capability that's bound to make your life as a data enthusiast that much smoother. You simply right-click to save a website into HTML, upload that HTML file by dragging, and ask Code Interpreter to parse it and do the heavy lifting for you. Oh, and did I mention it has the BeautifulSoup package integrated into it? We're talking next-level simplicity and efficiency here, folks!

So, if you're ready to take your web scraping skills to new heights, join me as we delve into the wonders of HTML parsing and data extraction with ChatGPT's Code Interpreter. Let's get started!

## Code Interpreter In Action

Let's see Code Interpreter in action. First you need to make sure that Code Interpreter is activated for a new GPT-4 chat window in ChatGPT:

Here you can see that Code Interpreter uses a Python script (making use of web scraping library Beautiful Soup) to extract the requested data from the HTML file.

Next Code Interpreter is generating the source code which is needed to generate a markdown table presenting the extracted data:

After the code is executed ChatGPT gives you the sample markdown output for the first 5 datasets:
